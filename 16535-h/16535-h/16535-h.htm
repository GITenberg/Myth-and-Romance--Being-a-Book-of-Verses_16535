<span class="i0">When I go forth to greet the glad-faced Spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Just at the time of opening apple-buds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When brooks are laughing, winds are whispering,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">On babbling hillsides or in warbling woods,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There is an unseen presence that eludes:&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps a Dryad, in whose tresses cling<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The loamy odors of old solitudes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, from her beechen doorway, calls; and leads<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My soul to follow; now with dimpling words<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of leaves; and now with syllables of birds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While here and there&mdash;is it her limbs that swing?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">While from her dripping hair and breasts and hips,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The moisture rains cool music on the grass.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her have I heard and followed, yet, alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have seen no more than the wet ray that dips<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The shivered waters, wrinkling where I pass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, in the liquid light, where she doth hide,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I have beheld the azure of her gaze<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Smiling; and, where the orbing ripple plays,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Among her minnows I have heard her lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bubbling, make merry by the waterside.<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[4] </span>
<span class="i2">Like morning's rose, mantling her brow and breast:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Stands for a startled moment ere she flies,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Her deep hair blowing, up the mountain crest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wild as a mist that trails along the dawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And is't her footfalls lure me? or the sound<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of airs that stir the crisp leaf on the ground?<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Their feet gone mad with music: now, perchance,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Sylvanus sleeping, on whose leafy trance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Nymphs stand gazing in dim ambuscades<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of sun-embodied perfume.&mdash;Myth, Romance,<br /></span>

<h2><a name="SOME_NOTICES_OF_MR_CAWEINS_VERSES" id="SOME_NOTICES_OF_MR_CAWEINS_VERSES"></a>SOME NOTICES OF MR. CAWEIN'S VERSES</h2>


<p>"I should like to praise the poetry of Madison Cawein, of Kentucky,
which is as remote as Greece from the actual everyday life of his
region; as remote from it as the poetry of Keats was from the England
of his day, and which is yet so richly, so passionately true to the
presence and essence of nature as she can be known only in the
Southern West. I named Keats with no purpose of likening this young
poet to him, but since he is named it is impossible not to recognize
that they are of the same Hellenic race; full of like rapture in sky
and field and stream, and of a like sensitive reluctance from whatever
chills the joy of sense in youth, in love, in melancholy. I know Mr.
Cawein has faults, and very probably he knows it, too; his delight in
color sometimes plunges him into mere paint; his wish to follow a
subtle thought or emotion sometimes lures him into empty dusks; his
devotion to nature sometimes contents him with solitudes bereft of the
human interest by which alone the landscape lives. But he is, to my
thinking, a most genuine poet, and one of these few Americans, who,
even in their over-refinement, could never be mistaken for Europeans;
who perhaps by reason of it are only the more American."&mdash;<span class="smcap">William
Dean Howells</span> in <i>Literature</i>.</p><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_3" id="Page_2_3"></a>[3]</span></p>

<p>"From the poetry of our day I select that of Madison Cawein as an
example of conspicuous merit. Many American readers have enjoyed Mr.
Cawein's productions.... But the appreciation of his poetry has never
been as great as its merits would indicate. His poems are rather <i>too
good</i> to be caught up on the babbling tongue and cast forth into mere
popularity. They are caviare to the general; and yet they have in them
the best elements of popular favor.</p>

<p>"Cawein is a classicist. He will have it that poems, however humble
the theme, however tender the sentiment, shall wear a tasteful Attic
dress. I do not intimate that Mr. Cawein's mind has been too much
saturated with the classical spirit or that his native instincts have
been supplanted with Greek exotics and flowers out of the renaissance,
but rather that his own mental constitution is of a classical as well
as a romantic mould.</p>

<p>"The themes of Cawein's poetry are generally taken from the world of
romance. If there be any modern bard who can recreate a medi&aelig;val
castle and give to its inhabitants the sentiments which were theirs in
the twelfth century, Cawein is the poet who can. He takes delight in
the East. He is the Omar Khayyam of the Ohio Valley. He is as much of
a Mohammedan as a Christian. He knows the son of Abdallah better than
he knows Cromwell; and has more sympathy with a Khalif than with a
Colonel. He dwells in the romantic regions of life; but the romance is
real. The hope is a true hope. The dream is a true dream. The picture
is a painting, and not a chromo. The love is a passion, and not a
dilettante episode. Cawein's art is a genuine art. His verse is
exquisite. Out of the three hundred and thirteen poems in the five<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2_4" id="Page_2_4"></a>[4]</span>
volumes under consideration there may be found hardly a false or
broken harmony...."&mdash;<span class="smcap">John Clark Ridpath, LL.D.</span>, in <i>The
Arena</i>.</p>

<p>"The rattlesnake-weed and the bluet-bloom were unknown to Herrick and
to Wordsworth, but such art as Mr. Cawein's makes them at home in
English poetry. There is passion, too, and thought in his
equipment...."&mdash;<span class="smcap">William Archer</span> in the <i>Pall Mall Magazine</i>.</p>

<p>"I find in the best pieces an intoxicating sense of beauty, a
richness, that is rarely achieved, although every young poet nowadays
strives after it. I find, too, a daring use of language which
sometimes, nay often, conducts to genuine and startling
felicities."&mdash;<span class="smcap">Edmund Gosse</span>.</p>

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity

opportunities to fix the problem.

or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
